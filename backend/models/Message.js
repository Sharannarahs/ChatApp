/*

It means the field (senderId or receiverId) stores an ObjectId â€” which is the unique ID automatically created by MongoDB for every document.

This ID points to another document in a different collection

ref tells Mongoose that this ObjectId refers to a document in the User model

This enables something called population (explained below), which allows you to fetch the full user document instead of just the ID.
